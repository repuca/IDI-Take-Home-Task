# IDI-Take-Home-Task
This repo was created as a response to request from John Wihbey from Northeastern University which was
a part of job hiring process. No code other than contained in the pdf file was produced. All code samples 
were created using references to available manuals and stackoverflow posts on Docker and Mongodb.

It is assumed that docker desktop is installed on user's computer. If not some instructions need to be converted into
command prompt version using docker commands.
